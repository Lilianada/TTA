            I am a Nigerian based Lifestyle blogger and Front-end Web Developer.
           Also a student of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, studing Primary Education. 
            <br>I started blogging in 2016 after my secondary school education. I got inspired by <strong>SIAINSTYLE</strong>, still inspired by her to start and run my own blog.
            <br><strong>Confused Creative</strong> is a name I came up with because I had struggles staying consistent doing a particular thing. I'm a little less confused than I used to be. 
            I am passionate about web development and design. I write about the lessons I've learnt about adulting and my journey as a self-taught developer in the Tech Industry on <a href="blog.html" style="color: #0460A0ff;">My blog</a>.
            I also started a community to teach children from the age of 10 to 18 to code. 
            I enjoy painting and tending to my plants, still considering adopting a pet.

            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <p>I love to learn about arts & tech, which keeps my mind creative & artsy. 
              This may explain why I daydream so often – I’m not usually thinking about the present.

            <p>Ideas get me going, they inspire & excite me. In fact, other than twitter, 
              they are what gets me up in the morning. From economics to outer space to code, I love it all.
